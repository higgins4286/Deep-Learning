# Deep-Learning

This repository contains the deep learning projects I completed in my Deep Learning course at the University of Missouri-Kansas City.

The deep learning topics are as follows:

1. Signal classification. (RBF_NN_for_Breast_Cancer_Detection.py)
2. Creating transfer networks using AlexNet and VGG-19 as the pretrained classifiers and measuring accuracy with ROC, AUC, sensitivity index, and rank 1 and rank 5. (all others)
